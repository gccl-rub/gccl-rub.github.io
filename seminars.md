# GCCL Seminars

The GCCL Seminar is a virtual video-link seminar where we invite speakers from around the globe to present their recent arxiv posting.   The seminars are fairly interactive, with speakers quizzed about the details of the analysis throughout the talk to ensure that everyone understands.   GCCL members from all nodes across Germany join this fortnightly event.    

If you would like to give a seminar at the GCCL please contact Dr Mijin Yoon.
